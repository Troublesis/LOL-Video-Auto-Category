Python script which will automatically sort League of legends videos base on the game mode and champion which was in the video.

I created a little python script which will automatically sort League of legends videos base on the game mode (currently only support normal / aram) and champion which was in the video. I am a new python learner and the code still has some issues. I am still happy it is partically working. Hope you will find this code is useful and hope you can help me to improve this code. Please let me knwo if you have any good ideas and give some advice on how to improve the code.

Known Issues:

To Do List: 
make champion detection function more accurate
detect all champions in the video
detect final kda in the video
detect more game mode (eg. urf/teamfight tactics)
